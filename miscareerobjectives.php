                                        Management Information Systems (MIS) encompass computer programs that equip managers with tools in organizing, evaluating and the departments within an organization efficiently. In this regard, MIS is significant in any organization that uses computers extensively, typically the specific job market.  These include financial organization, online retailers, software companies, and central government, universities and even hospitals. The job market is not limited considering technology is evolving so fast and many organizations have gone digital and are using computers. For organizations to capture the past and present information, it installs a software needful in decision making, databases and hardware basically forming the management information systems.  Notably, the MIS curriculum covers several domains both in business and IT course, and my specialization is to practice as an Information Technology (IT) manager.

                                    <p>
                                        As an information technology manager, I play numerous job functions when implementing and administering technology within the organization.  Importantly, I plan, coordinate and lead in any research pertaining to computer activities in the organization. In cooperation with managers from other departments, we prioritize the vision of the firm and implement the right technology to meet the goals. I dwell more on the technical aspect of the organization like developing the software, internet settings, and network security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Besides, I direct other IT experts in the execution of daily duties; for instance computer programmers, system analysts and software engineers. Regardless of the professionals` knowledge, I plan and coordinate their activities in installing and upgrading the software, implementation of network and development website. Right to say, I assign and review the activities by the subordinates to get rid of simple errors that may cost the organization. I also have to do an analysis of the need for information by the organization from a strategic and operational view as well as determine the long term goals.

                                        Another job function is analyzing the latest technologies that may be useful in the company. This means I can invite new advancement in technology within the organization so that it remains competitive. Whenever a helpful tool is identified, as the IT manager, I am responsible for the test and implementation, including stating the specific cost-benefit to the management and the expected returns on the investment.  Lastly, I am responsible for managing all the computing resources in the firm. As the manager, I have to ensure the availability of the resources, their continuity, and safety.

                                        My personal attribute for the role of IT manager is such that I am confident, which implies, I know my worth, and always ready to prove myself in expressing confidence in my expertise. I am also proactive; I don't wait to be told and instead lead by example, and finally, I am resilient, sure of coming up in the job regardless of what it takes. Additionally, I believe I possess both the technical skills and nontechnical skills required for the job. One, I have excellent problem-solving skills and strong technical skills.

                                    <p>The MSIS program prepared me to tackle the targeted job market and specialization domain. Being an ideal student for Management information systems, I was able to determine the right career that suits me. Like I mentioned earlier, I specialize as an IT manager that has equipped me with a range of technical skill in handling matters about computers. So far I have been able to demonstrate expertise in the technology and business at the same time; fields that employers mainly seek to absorb in the competitive world today. I have also built on my skills in network administration, hardware, and software. Meaning I can design, execute and oversee the information systems in any firm further even improving their efficiency. I am convinced I can set up a strategic plan and implement in an organization in addition to analyzing and addressing the IT challenges.</p>

                                        During the MSIS programs, I have been able to accomplish five different assignments in demonstrating my IT knowledge to the job market. I successfully manage the business data. Business management is interested in in the information about the entire operation of the business which as an IT expert I managed to execute during the training. I system such that it can store the present data and retrieve it from any department, my case by the management team. In cases the manager requested for the income or expenses in a company, the information is easily retrieved from the system immediately. Management of information systems gives information gives access to all departments to feed in data always dependent on each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Similarly, I am able to create informed business decisions. Decisions become valid depending on the information on which they are based. Management information systems, therefore, make the process of decision making better since the information obtained is accurate, timely and detailed. The fact that the system conducts thorough check-up that limits the number of errors, more often set in a manner to highlight the specific information that is incomplete, wrong or missing.  This is possible because all employees work under the same database and the monitoring of activities done at the central point in the IT department.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The MSIS program also trains me in the analysis of business trends. In any organization, the critical role of the manager is preparing for future strategic plans and budgets. Management of information systems carries both past and latest data for significant functions of the company like customer care services, production, and sales. Ultimately, the administration requires such information in making strategic plans for the organization. At this point, the system is installed with software that can calculate the future trends, on which accurate forecast is based upon.

                                    <p>
                                        The next assignment is examining the strategies and scenarios. Once the management team comes up with the strategic plans, the management information system examines the strategy and the situations to determine the safety of the decisions. The system evaluates different outcomes and also review the conditions which turn too powerful to settle on the best strategy for the organization. Ideally, MIS computes, what plan is implemented depending on the data collected and the past performance by the organization.

                                    <p>
                                        Lastly, I am able to create a consistent channel of work. One process is dependent on each other in many cases; hence it is more effective to carry the operations on one platform. The management information system sets the system to relay information from one department via a cloud network. This reduces time wasting and improved access in of information by both employees and employer.

                                        Separately, I believe understanding the evolution of information technology provides the need to remain competitive in the market. The first era dates back in the mid-1960-1970 when MIS was first computerized. The information systems were centrally located and purely utilized during management. A lot of information was stored in the accounting department and technology mainly encompassed third generation computers, like IBM models.  In the second era, more departments begun to benefit from the MIS, in the mid-1970s until 1980s. The steering head initiated more IS projects. Personal computers and microcomputers were the leading technology.

                                    <p>
                                        The third era falls between the mid-1980s and 1990s. The centralized information systems spread out becoming decentralized. Every department had its computers leading to the creation of a new department in the organizations and beginning of internetworking. The fourth era continued in the after 1990 to-date, and information systems are still used in governance. However, the systems are distributed all over the organization to all employees. The main advancement is the MIS has been integrated between the business and its clients so that they can readily access information. Technology lies on social media and other search engines on platforms like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

                                </div>
                                <div class="typography-line">
                                    <p>
                                       The gap analysis, sometimes known as the IS failure, is assessed by analysis of two main components. One is the company, which is the user of information systems and the requirements and secondly, the IS user`s perception of the performance of the delivered system probably after using the system.  A difference in the expectation and the perception even in one transaction causes user dissatisfaction. The cause of dissatisfaction, in turn, results in the negative feeling of the user, forcing them to reject the system sometimes. Precisely, the system my mismatch the information with useful aspects or provide insufficient functionality. Moreover, the IS may provide poor performance and not fit the practices by the organization. Interestingly, the system may fail in all the mentioned fields but still conform to the purpose it is designed to perform and specific roles between the users and developers. Therefore, the information systems must be crossed from one side of the organization as a bridge between the technological solutions and organizational problems. Regardless of the values of a system project, it may not perform as expected by the users causing the gap.
